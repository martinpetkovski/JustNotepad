# JustNotepad

Yeah, I got genuinely tired of ::certain companies:: shoving LLM "AI" into the most basic things like file editing using Notepad, so I figured the best way to retaliate is to vibe code Just Notepad using LLMs. 

Just Notepad is just a notepad. As simple as it gets. 2MB of RAM on startup, 3 if you're unlucky. File loading is blazing fast, even for large files. Won't freeze, won't do anything other than what you ask it to do, it's just a notepad and always will be.

[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/martinpetkovski/JustNotepad/releases/latest)

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Just Notepad | Windows Notepad |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM Usage (Startup)** | ~2 MB | ~65 MB+ |
| **Large File Loading (300MB+)** | Blazing Fast | Significant Delay |
| **Responsiveness** | Always Snappy | Can Lag with Large Files |
| **AI Integration** | Hypotethical plugin that you can disable | Built-in / Bloatware |
| **Architecture** | Native Win32 | UWP / WinUI |

## Plugins

The only bonus feature over the regular Notepad is extensibility. You can create you're own LLM "AI" plugin if ya want.

Here's an extensive list of all the plugins and what I use them for:

- **AdvancedSearchPlugin**: Advanced search capabilities (Regex, etc.).

- **HexEditorPlugin**: View and edit files in hexadecimal format.
- **PowerShellScripts**: Run Powershell scripts based on context.
